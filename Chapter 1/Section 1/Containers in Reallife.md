#Containers in Reallife
The containers are a concept that applied to many of the products we use daily. For example, Android uses containers to separate Applications (Dalvik VM). Also Google announced in Google I/O 2014, that use containers to host user Apps and all their cloud services and they announced that they create 2 billion containers/week.
Also containers as an ecosystem have raised in the latest few years with some of the applications that **includes**:

####Highly performant, hyper scale deployments of hosts
Containers are known for both their high density/host and rapid start time which are a core feature to hyper scale deployment.

####Micro-Services architecture
Micro-services is a concept that adds to the SOA Architecture in a way to divide a service into Sub services to increase isolation and allow better control to the deployment ways of the services.

####Building a multi-user Platform-as-a-Service (PAAS) infrastructure
Sharing an OS layer is one of the best ways to implement a shared platform

####Sharing Environments between Developers
Containers could encapsulate both an infrastructure and a code which allows synchronous development tools and stack.

####Testing Environments
Bootstrapping a container with a test environment is a matter of seconds which eases the process of testing new tools and code on the required environment.

####Research Validation
Shipping a research with a container containing all the needed code and tools to prove a research is an ultimate utility for research verification.
