# IO Control

####Block IO bandwidth (Blkio) constraint
By default, all containers get the same proportion of block IO bandwidth (blkio). This proportion is 500. To modify this proportion, change the containerâ€™s blkio weight relative to the weighting of all other running containers using the **--blkio-weight** flag.
The **--blkio-weight** flag can set the weighting to a value between 10 to 1000.
####Examples
```$ docker run -ti --name c1 --blkio-weight 300 ubuntu:14.04 /bin/bash```

```$ docker run -ti --name c2 --blkio-weight 600 ubuntu:14.04 /bin/bash```

>The blkio weight setting is only available for direct IO. Buffered IO is not currently supported.
