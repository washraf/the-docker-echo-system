# Installation Prerequisites

Docker must be installed on 64 bit OS with kernel more than 3.10.
The kernel must support an appropriate storage driver. 

For example:
* 
Device Mapper
* 
AUFS
* 
vfs
* 
btrfs

The default storage driver is usually Device Mapper for centos and redhat and AUFS for ubuntu.
